# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.


## The challenge

The challenge was  build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## Building the project

Process:

1. I started defining the HTML structure and making it look good with CSS, starting with mobile view first.
2. I used JavaScript to change between different styles to display the mobile menu.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
ðŸš€ .classList.toggle
ðŸš€ .addEventListener

### Continued development
I want to improve my DOM manipulation habilities and how to change styles with JavaScript.
