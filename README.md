# test-sites

## What it's this? 🤔

This is a repo to uploading different test sites that I made to improve my skills with HTML and CSS.
For now I'm starting with this, in the near future I want to include JavaScript in my proyects.

If you're reading this, please, give me feedback, I want to improve as much as I can 🤗

Proyects:
### Stats preview card component 🗃️ [Link](https://k3gar.github.io/test-sites/card-component/).
I made this site using the flex propiedad, it has two views, mobile and desktop view. I made it as a challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
